Get Start
=====================
  Though most users want to get the content of an Excel file, I want create an Excel file first and it can be useful 
in further training.
  Just like when learning about Database, I use the course/student for demonstration. In table views, they looks like:

STUDENT
---------------------------
ID |NAME      |STUDENT_NUMBER|GRADE|GENDER | BIRTHDAY
------------------------------------------------------
 1  Allen                1201     3      M   1992-08-28
 2  Bob                  1106     4      M   1991-12-02
 3  Julianne             1318     2      F   1993-01-28
 4  Thomas               1202     3      M   1993-05-16

COURSE(from http://oyc.yale.edu/courses)
---------------------------
DEPARTMENT            | COURSE_NUMBER | COURSE_TITLE                                        |PROFESSOR_NAME     | DATE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Psychology              PSYC 123        The Psychology, Biology and Politics of Food         Brownell, Kelly D.   Fall 2008
Political Science       PLSC 118        The Moral Foundations of Politics                    Shapiro, Ian         Spring 2010
History                 HIST 210        The Early Middle Ages, 284â€“1000                      Freedman, Paul       Fall 2011
History                 HIST 119        The Civil War and Reconstruction Era, 1845-1877      Blight, David W.     Spring 2008
Geology and Geophysics  GG 140          The Atmosphere, the Ocean, and Environmental Change  Smith, Ronald B.     Fall 2011

Now generate the student table in a sheet, and save the file. The course table can be generated in the same way.


1.Create Excel File
=====================
  Though it's 2012, the MS Office 2007 has been released years ago, we get the .xls file from time to time.
  Unlike swing or awt which add the component to panel, in POI, you need to create a workbook first, then create a sheet 
using this workbook, so as to the row and cell.
      workbook --> sheet --> row --> cell
